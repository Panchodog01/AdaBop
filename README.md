# AdaBop
Simple Bopit sytle game for the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express

The board will run through a simple game where it says one of four actions and the player must do the action within a certain time frame to earn points
Failing to do the action will reset the game and save any highscore that have been played

As your score gets higher the time to complete each action will get shorter

The four actions are:
Press it: Press either of the two buttons on the board
Switch it: Switch the switch at the top of the board
Shut it: Cover the light sensor by the left button
Turn it: Flip the board upside down
